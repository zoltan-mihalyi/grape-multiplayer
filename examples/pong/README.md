This is the online multiplayer version of the pong game.
You can start the server with the following commands:

- `npm install` installs dependencies.
- `node index.js` runs the server.
- run index.grape-dev.html

The differences between this and the shared keyboard version are:

- When you click "New game" you connect to the server. If two players are connected, the server creates a game for you, and you can play.
- TODO
